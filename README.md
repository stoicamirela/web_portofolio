# web_portofolio
Just a showcase for web portofolio, with edited images and videos.
Created with React.js for easy formatting. Components are the navbar, the logo, and the content which appears on scroll.
Images are taken from internet and edited by me in Pixlr, Canva. For videos I used CapCut. For the logo I used only Canva.
Idea is that there is a fictive company name GraphicDesign.io which specializes in offering services of graphic design
for other companies.


For downloading, extract the zip, go to an IDE, terminal, or VS code (you need the terminal for the command, so you don't need to worry where).
In the extracted folder "web_portofolio",
 cd portofolio
 npm start and you see a webpage with all contents.
For the needed packages, please check the import statements since I haven't made a requirements.txt file yet. Thank you!

Deployment for directly testing the project is done at this page:
