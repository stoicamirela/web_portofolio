# web_portofolio
Just a showcase for web portofolio, with edited images and videos.
Created with React.js for easy formatting. Components are the navbar, the logo, and the content which appears on scroll.
Images are taken from internet and edited by me in Pixlr, Canva. For videos I used CapCut. For the logo I used only Canva.
Idea is that there is a fictive company name GraphicDesign.io which specializes in offering services of graphic design
for other companies.
